This program will list contacts that you enter into the program.
It can also delete them.
That's about it. :)

As for setup... well, I'm assuming you have to set up a local host
by pointing the cmnd box or terminal at the web folder and then running

php -S localhost:8000

Then type your contacts into the fields. Click "Add Contact" to add, and
"Clear" to delete all contacts and start over.
